Sharar, Abdul Halim (1860-1926) prolific Urdu language novelist, historian, essayist, translator,
poet and publisher. His fiction writing was motivated by the desire to instruct and he found the
novel to be the form of writing most up to that task. In the pages of his most successful journal,
Dil Gudaz, he serially published Urdu’s first historical novels and attempted to arouse the hearts
of Indian Muslims that they might regain their preeminent place in the world. That time and
place he recalled was not only when Muslims were at the height of global learning and
civilization, but also the more recent past when Muslims ruled India. Sharar’s prolific writing in
many genres made him one of the more prominent figures in the developing discourse of Muslim
historical consciousness after the Insurrection of 1857. Sharar also seems to be the first
Indian Muslim to articulate the possibility for a partitioning of the subcontinent in his journal
Muhazzib (Refined) in 1890. Sharar was born in 1860 in Lucknow to Tafuzzul Hussain Khan, a
scholar of Islamic religion and Arabic and Persian literature. In 1862 he departed for Calcutta
under the employment of Wajid Ali Shah in Matiya Burj and Sharar joined him in 1869 staying
until 1876 with short visits to Lucknow every few years. Sharar’s mother was the daughter of
Munshi Qamar ud Din who was employed in the Secretariat of the Court of Wajid Ali Shah. As
a youth Sharar studied Persian and Arabic language and literature and Islamic theology while his
interest in Urdu literature also grew. In Matiya Burj, Sharar spent a significant portion of his
time with the princes seeking out pleasure and in 1876 when news of Sharar’s frivolous lifestyle
reached his father’s ears he decided to send Sharar back to Lucknow. There his lifestyle
underwent a dramatic transformation as he began spending most of his time in the company of
religious scholars.</p>
    <p>In 1879 when he was 18 Sharar married his first cousin and shortly thereafter in 1880
disappeared from his home and traveled to Delhi to pursue his studies of hadith at a seminary
there. Sharar stayed for almost two and a half years there and it was during that time that he first
read Altaf Husain Hali’s Musaddas e-Madd o-Jazr e-Islam, reading it many times. With its
focus on the rise and fall of Islam in the subcontinent Sharar was deeply affected and this theme
of Islam’s glorious past contrasted with the present conditions subsequently proved a central
theme throughout Sharar’s writings. Shortly after returning to Lucknow his father accepted an
offer of employment in Hardoi and Sharar followed him there where he found employment
teaching Arabic to Sayyid Muhammad Reza’s son who eventually became Lucknow’s Chief
Court Judge. Sharar considered taking the law exam for the Revenue Agency and even spent
time studying with his friends who were also preparing for the exam but nothing resulted from
this. Sharar began spending a great amount of time at Maulvi Suraj ul Hasan’s home where his
close relationship to a prostitute and the ensuing commotion resulted in Sharar having to leave
Hardoi. Upon Sharar’s return to Lucknow in the beginning of 1882 he began conversing
regularly with Munshi Ahmad ‘Ali Kasmandavi, a well-known Urdu columnist in Awadh Punch.
It was Kasmandavi who chose the pen-name for Abdul Halim and encouraged Sharar to begin
writing for newspapers. Shortly after this Sharar started writing for Akhbar Tamanai, a weekly
paper published by Munshi Ram Sahad Tamana’s father, Puranchand ‘Ajaz.</p>
    <p>As Sharar desired to find a salaried job Muhammad Abdul Hai of Firangi Mahal
Seminary advised him to work as an editor for Newal Kishore Press and provided him a letter of
recommendation that secured the job for Sharar. Two days before the end of 1883 Sharar arrived
at Newal Kishore and was appointed an editor. Everything about the job though was not to
Sharar’s liking and after just 15 days of doing that type of work he became greatly discouraged.
One day Newal Kishore asked Sharar why he had chosen a type of work where there is no hope
of advancement. Sharar asked him what he should do and Newal Kishore suggested that if it was
possible he should write articles in Awadh Akhbar. Newal Kishore encouraged Sharar to rent a
place nearby for which he would pay half the rent and so Sharar’s daily writing in
Awadh Akhbar began in exchange for 30 rupees a month and half his rent. In 1884 upon returning
from Mumbai Sharar attempted to collect the money owed him by Newal Kishore and after great difficulty in
collecting he gained release from his employment under Newal Kishore.</p>
    <p>The editor of another journal Payam-e Yar, Munshi Nisar Hussain, was a good friend of
Sharar’s and in friendship Sharar would regularly write for the journal and do some editing as
well as printing. Hussain advised Sharar to write a novel for which he would advertise in his
journal Payam-e Yar and print in his printing press. Sharar agreed and wrote the first part of his
novel Dilchasp. It received such a warm welcome that the first edition sold out in just a few
days and he published the second section along with the second printing of Dilchasp.</p>
    <p>Sharar taught himself English with the help of an Arabic grammar and after reading the
English translation of Bankimchandra Chatterjee’s novel Durgesh Nandini decided to translate it
which Nisar Hussain then printed from his Qaumi Press. Sharar continued to periodically write
articles for Payam-e Yar but struggled to find work with adequate compensation. During 1884-
86, Bashir ul Din, the son of Deputy Nazir Ahmad, came regularly to Lucknow as a guest of
Nisar Hussain and would converse with Sharar. In late 1886 upon seeing Sharar’s discouraged
state at not finding any suitable employment he encouraged Sharar to start a monthly journal
written in the style of Dilchasp. Bashir ul Din gave Sharar 5 rupees for 5 subscribers and
with this money Sharar printed and distributed advertisements for his new journal
Dil Gudaz in Payam-e Yar. Within only four months of starting his journal in January of 1887,
the monthly publication grew to more than 1,000 copies. At its height it had a monthly subscription
of close to 2,500. Apart from a few breaks, Sharar consistently published Dil Gudaz until his death in
December 1926 after which his son Muhammad Sadiq Hasan continued to publish it until at least
1934. In the middle of 1887 Suraj ul Din started his own paper, Sir Moore Gazette, and he
requested a novel from Sharar to include for his subscribers. In a few days time Sharar wrote the
first part of his second novel, Dilkash and later wrote the second part and both received a warm
welcome from the readership. As Sharar’s English improved he read Sir Walter Scott’s The Talisman,
a historical novel that dealt with the third Crusade. The negative portrayal of Muslims
in Scott’s book infuriated Sharar and he then decided to write his own novel, Malik-ul Aziz
Virgina, which found its way serially into Dil Gudaz in 1888. Sharar based this work on a
fictional romance between ‘Aziz, the son of Salah-ud-Din Ayyubi (1138-1193) and Vargina, the
niece of King Richard who meet on the battlefield in Syria. The heroine of the novel, Vargina
converts to Islam and ends up fighting on behalf of the Muslims.</p>
    <p>Sharar attempted to combine English forms and styles of writing with that of the Persian
and Urdu traditions and his fictional works while referred to as novels continued to employ many of
the tropes found in the qissa and dastan traditions. In 1889 he published Hasan Anjelina, and Mansur
Mohana in 1890. In 1890 Sharar also began another journal, Muhazzib (Refined) as an avenue to write
about politics, society and literature. In 1891 Sharar departed for Hyderabad where he was to provide
an Indo-Islamic education to the youngest son of Viqar-ul Omrah while he studied in England. The trip
to England did not take place though until 1893 and Sharar ended up returning to India in late 1896
resuming publication of Dil Gudaz in March 1897 from Hyderabad. The travelogues he subsequently printed
in Dil Gudaz, highlight Sharar’s concern for the depressed state of Muslims throughout the world.
Sharar then published in quick succession Ayyam-e Arab, serialized in his journal, Flora Florinda,
a novel set in 10th century Andulasia (printed in installments in 1893 but not completed until 1899)
and his most popular novel, Firdaus-e Birin(Paradise of the Assasins) plotted around the Assassins
during the 13th century. It was also shortly after returning from Europe that Sharar began writing
his biography of Imam Husain’s daughter Sakina that went against accepted opinion and created great
outrage, particularly among Shias, forcing him to leave Hyderabad on the Nizam’s orders. In 1900
Sharar began another journal Parda-e Ismat and published some of his social novels, one of which was
Badr ul Nissa ki Musibat demonstrating the ill effects of a strict parda system. He was an advocate of
women’s education.</p>
    <p>In 1904 as Sharar continued to observe the relationship between Hindus and Muslims deteriorate
he began another journal, Ittihad the purpose of which was to foster better relations between the
communities. Perhaps Sharar’s greatest non fiction contributions were his series of essays he
published from 1914-1919 entitled Hindūstāñ Meñ Mashriqī Tamaddun kā Āḳhrī Namūna (The Last
Example of an Eastern Culture in Hindustan), later published as a book, Guzashta Lucknow
(Lucknow Past) and translated into English in 1971. Sharar described in vivid detail the cultural
world of Lucknow that flourished during the era of the Nawabs. These writings have become a
standard source for historians writing on this period. Sharar was employed by the Nizam in
Hyderabad for a number of years in the Education Department as well as in the Finance
Department but due to a controversy in 1909 was forced to leave Hyderabad without any
severance pay. Sharar struggled financially throughout his life; many other publishers printed
and sold his books for less money and Sharar received no financial compensation for this
widespread dispersal of his works. His debts became so great that at one point he was taken to
court and ordered to repay his debts in monthly installments.</p>
    <p>With the death of the Nizam, Mahboob Ali Khan in 1911 and the ascension of his son Osman
Ali Khan to the throne Sharar was recalled to Hyderabad in 1919 by the Nizam to write his biography.
The Nizam later changed his mind and instead employed Sharar to write a history of Islam. Sharar
completed two volumes of his Tarikh-e Islam (History of Islam) before his death in 1926. Sharar
continued to publish historical works, novels, biographies and an assortment of articles until
his death in 1926. Sharar wrote a total of 25 historical novels, 8 social novels, 24 biographical
works, 21 histories, 2 dramas, 4 significant poetical works, translated 8 works into Urdu and wrote
innumerable articles in his 10 different journals that appeared at various times throughout his
life. Sharar died in December of 1926 in Lucknow. Sharar’s impact on Urdu literature is still
felt today, particularly in the genre of historical fiction and his writing on Lucknow continues to
inform the imagination of many.</p>
